  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <p>
    This site exists for one reason: to document what matters.
  </p>
  <p>
    No fluff. No endless scrolling. Just ideas, code, thoughts, and tools that serve a purpose.
    If it’s here, it’s here for a reason.
  </p>
  <p>
    I built this space to organize knowledge, track progress, and keep everything that matters in one place.
    From development logs to mental models — this is the archive.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nothing is permanent. Everything evolves. But the intent remains clear:  
    <strong>build, refine, and move forward.</strong>

  <h1>About Me (extend)</h1>
  <p>
    I go by the name Saintseaka.
    I don’t follow trends or noise. I build, observe, and move with purpose.
    I’m driven by curiosity, sharpened by solitude, and grounded in reality.
  </p>
  <p>
    My focus is on learning things that matter — from programming and philosophy to martial arts and quantum theory.
    I don’t claim to know everything, but I take my time understanding what I choose to pursue.
  </p>
  <p>
    No gimmicks. No filters. Just consistent effort and clarity of intent.
    If something needs to be done, I figure it out and get it done.
  </p>
  <p>
    You’re either building or consuming. I choose to build.
